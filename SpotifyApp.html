<p>This is the landing page of the (to be built) Spotify App. Somehow, It will use the Spotify API to give you all your playlists & relted information as a CSV.</p>
<p>A good use case would be to uncouple your Spotify and Facebook accounts. Currently, you're forced to create a new account if you want to uncouple Spotify and Facebook, if you've
    created your Spotify Account using Facebook, which is the same mistake I made. 
</p>
<p>The downside is, you'll lose all your playlists and saved music. So, besides giving you a .csv file of your playlists for your pleasure and convenience, this ncie little website / webapp will
    allow you to download all your playlists and upload them to your newly created user account.

<p>{Something with storing those songs}</p>
<p>{Something with sending them to a new Spotify Account}</p>

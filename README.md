# To do
- [X] Change the whole thing to a node app. Create index.js and have it serve up index.html, so you can host locally using nodemon: it now servers index.html, but e.g. the headers aren't rendered. 

# How to

## Setup development environment
- `npm install`
- `$ npm i -g local-web-server`
- `$ ws` to start up local server on localhost:8000

# To do
- [X] Change the whole thing to a node app. Create index.js and have it serve up index.html, so you can host locally using nodemon: it now serves index.html, but e.g. the headers aren't rendered. 
- [X] Added local-web-server as package dependency  

# How to

## Setup development environment
- `npm install`
- `ws` to start up local server on localhost:8000
